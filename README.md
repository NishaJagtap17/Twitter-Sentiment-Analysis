# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.

Thousands of text documents can be processed for sentiment (and other features including named entities, topics, themes, etc.) in seconds, compared to the hours it would take a team of people to manually complete the same task.

This project is an attempt to solve the problem of text classification on twitter text datasâ€” the task is to predict whether a tweet is racist/sexist or not. The data has been downloaded from Kaggle  : Dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and Target, where Target '0' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist/negative and label '4' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist/positive, your objective is to predict the target on the test dataset.
